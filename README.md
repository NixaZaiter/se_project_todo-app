# Simple Todo App

As the name suggests, the application provides a simple Todo list generator with working validation for no empty (mandatory) fields.

## Functionality

- Check buttons work to show finished todo items.
- Every todo item has a delete button.
- Upon making a new todo button, the fields reset back to empty, but not upon closing without submitting.

## Technology

Code has been refactored to be less cluttered and consolidated to two main classes. The Todo class and the FormValidation class. Form reset functionality has also been added per request of the assignment.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on GitHub Pages:
